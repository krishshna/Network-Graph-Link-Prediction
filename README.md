# Network-Graph-Link-Prediction

Using a social media dataset comprising source and destination nodes, I conducted data preprocessing to enrich the dataset by incorporating additional features. 
This involved leveraging various similarity and distance measures such as cosine and Jaccard similarities. Following feature engineering, 
I executed several visualizations and employed diverse machine learning algorithms to forecast connections between individuals.
